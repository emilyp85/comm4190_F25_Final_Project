    "# Nicholas’s First Scenario\n",
    "## Short description: \n",
    "Invited to a party with an ambiguous theme\n",
    "\n",
    "## Narrative of the scenario:\n",
    "The user was invited to his friend’s birthday brunch and the theme of the party is “garden vibes.” He does not know what to wear to the event, given the vague theme and he does not want to buy new clothes for the party either. Since the user has uploaded his wardrobe into Fashion.AI, he opens the LLM and asks the AI to generate an outfit, using his preexisting clothes, for a “Garden vibes birthday brunch.” The user also uploaded the invitation for the brunch so the LLM can understand the aesthetic further. The LLM then pulls pieces of his clothes to generate an outfit that fits the theme of the party, without prompting the user to buy something else. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Step-by-step breakdown of the interaction:\n",
    "1) User opens Fashion.AI and selects “Event Outfit Generator.”\n",
    "2) User types: “I got invited to my friend’s birthday brunch and the theme is garden vibes.” \n",
    "3) User then uploaded an image of the invitation for the birthday party. \n",
    "4) The LLM responses: “Thank you! Based on the information you provided, the brunch is casual and relaxed, with a theme pulling on earth tones and pastels. Would you like me to generate an outfit based on your current wardrobe, provide recommendations for buying new clothes for this event, or a mix of both?”\n",
    "5) The user responds: “Can you generate an outfit based on clothes I already have?”\n",
    "6) The LLM response: “Yes! For this event, you can wear your *khaki pants* and *light blue button up shirt*. For shoes, wear your *brown dress shoes.* No need to accessorize for this event!” \n",
    "7) The user can then accept this outfit or ask the LLM to generate another one.\n",

    "## Data description\n",
    "* Needed for the app to engage and complete the scenario:\n",
    "* User input data:\n",
    "\t* Event type and theme (e.g., garden vibes birthday brunch)\n",
    "\t* Where the clothes are coming from (e.g. preexisting closet, new clothes to buy, etc.)\n",
    "* System data sources:\n",
    "\t* Pre-trained LLM embedded for fashion classification and styling knowledge\n",
    "* Data created as a result of the interaction:\n",
    "\t* Updated user profile (awareness of trends, preferred outfits, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation\n",
    "* Success criteria:\n",
    "\t* Generated outfits that fit the correct theme for the event.\n",
    "\t* The AI’s interpretation of the event matches the description provided by the user.\n",
    "\t* The user finds at least one outfit they feel confident and comfortable in wearing.\n",
    "* Possible complications or errors:\n",
    "\t* If the user gives vague or incomplete input, Fashion.AI might produce an incorrect output\n",
    "\t* If the user hasn’t uploaded all their clothes, the AI’s outfit suggestions might not be accurate.\n",
    "\t* The LLM could combine pieces that technically fit the theme but clash aesthetically or seasonally.\n",

    "# Nicholas’s Second Scenario\n",
    "## Short description: \n",
    "Looking to buy new clothes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Narrative of the scenario:\n",
    "The user notices that Urban Outfitters is having a Black Friday sale and wants to take advantage of the discounted clothing. Since Fashion.AI has an understanding of the user’s wardrobe and preferences, the user asks Fashion.AI to generate purchase recommendations for the sale based on current gaps in their wardrobe. The LLM then provides a list of clothes the user can purchase at Urban Outfitters that fit into their closet, fill gaps into their wardrobe, and allow the user to experiment with new styles and trends. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Step-by-step breakdown of the interaction:\n",
    "1) User opens Fashion.AI and selects “Shop & Fill My Closet”\n",
    "2) User tells Fashion.AI: “Urban Outfitters is having a Black Friday sale, help me pick what clothes I should by”\n",
    "3) The LLM responses asking for more information: “What is your budget? Do you want to fill gaps in your wardrobe, try out new styles, or more?” \n",
    "4) The user responses: “I want to fill gaps in my wardrobe”\n",
    "5) Fashion.AI pulls the user’s uploaded wardrobe data (styles, colors, missing categories, frequently worn items, and disliked items). The LLM analyzes the user’s closet for gaps and identifies complementary styles the user is likely to wear. The system queries Urban Outfitters’ Black Friday discounted inventory and filters items by the user’s constraints (price, size availability, etc).\n",
    "6) Fashion.AI generates a list of recommended purchases: “Consider purchasing the skate fit dark wash baggy jeans since you only have a light wash pair. Also consider purchasing the red cable knit sweater since you do not have any red tops in your current closet” \n",
    "7) The user than purchases these items\n",
