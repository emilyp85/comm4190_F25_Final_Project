    "# Fashion.AI — Workflow Notebook\n",
    "## 1. Overview\n",
    "Fashion.AI is an AI-powered personal styling assistant that helps users create outfits, evaluate their wardrobe, and make informed purchasing decisions. We designed a workflow that can support this functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "These internal processes reflect three main workflow typologies we discussed in class.\n",
    "1) Routing Workflow (Intent classification)\n",
    "2) Structured Generation Workflow (Outfit Creation)\n",
    "3) Transformative Workflow (Wardrobe-Based or Image-Based Styling)\n",
    "4) Recommendation Workflow (Shopping Suggestions)\n",
    "   \n",
    "## 2. Workflow Typologies in Detail\n",
    "### Intent Classifier Workflow\n",
    "In this workflow, we determine the user's intent:\n",
    "* Create an outfit\n",
    "* Style something using their existing wardrobe\n",
    "* Recommend items to buy\n",
    "* Analyze an uploaded piece of clothing\n",
    "* Something else (fallback)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow Type 1: Outfit Generation Workflow (Structured Generation)\n",
    "This workflow will be used when the user wants:\n",
    "* An outfit for an event\n",
    "* Theme-specific looks\n",
    "* Seasonal/weather-appropriate outfits\n",
    "* Body-shape-appropriate outfits\n",
    "* Everyday or interview style\n",
    "\n",
    "This workflow generates:\n",
    "1) Concept -->\n",
    "2) Outfit structure -->\n",
    "3) To final polished outfit and explanations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow Type 2: Wardrobe Transformation Workflow\n",
    "This workflow will be used when the user uploads their own clothing images or asks:\n",
    "* \"What can I make with these clothes?\"\n",
    "* \"How do I style this shirt?\"\n",
    "* \"What goes with this skirt?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The system parses wardrobe items and then transforms them into curated, personalized outfit suggestions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow Type 3: Shopping Recommendation Workflow\n",
    "This workflow will be used when a user asks:\n",
    "* \"I want to shop at Zara.\"\n",
    "* \"I need a dress under $80.\"\n",
    "* \"Recommend me pieces that match my current aesthetic or clothing style.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The system identifies gaps in the wardrobe and suggests new items that are not limited by brand or gender, as Fashion.AI is inclusive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow Type 4: Ask Clarifying Question or Return Error\n",
    "This workflow will be used if the intent classifier cannot confidently determine the user's goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Routing Workflow (Intent Classifier)\n",
    "The Mermaid Diagram for this LLM:\n",

    "## 4. Workflow Typologies with Mermaid Diagrams\n",
    "### Workflow Type 1: Outfit Generation Workflow\n",
    "This workflow is used when the user wants an outfit for a specific context:\n",
    "* party theme (i.e. “The Great Gatsby”)\n",
    "* job interview\n",
    "* dinner date\n",
    "* Halloween costume\n",
    "* seasonal or weather-based outfit\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "1) Extract event and aesthetic constraints\n",
    "2) Match constraints to fashion rules\n",
    "3) Build a structured outfit outline (top, bottom, shoes, outerwear, accessories, hair, makeup)\n",
    "4) Polish into full outfit recommendation\n",
    "5) Validate for functionality (weather, comfort, theme accuracy)\n",

    "### Workflow Type 2: Wardrobe Transformation Workflow\n",
    "This workflow is activated when:\n",
    "* The user uploads images of their clothes\n",
    "* The user wants outfits using their current wardrobe\n",
    "* The user wants styling guidance for a specific item\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "1) Parse wardrobe images or item descriptions (identify category, color, fabric, silhouette)\n",
    "2) Extract user request\n",
    "3) Match wardrobe items to styling rules\n",
    "4) Assemble compatible outfit(s)\n",

    "* to fill gaps in wardrobe\n",

    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "1) Extract budget, preferred brands, sizing, color palette\n",
    "2) Identify wardrobe gaps or needs\n",
