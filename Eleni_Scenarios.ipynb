    "## Narrative of the Scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario 1\n",
    "Before a high-stakes interview, the user has a blazer, trousers, blouse, and heels sitting in an online cart, all picked in their “usual size.” Before checking out, they upload the cart to the LLM. The system already knows their measurements, shoulder width, inseam, comfort limits for heel height, and what’s in their existing wardrobe. It scans product pages and reviews, flags that the blazer runs small in the shoulders and recommends sizing up, points out that the pants inseam will fall awkwardly and suggests a better length, warns that the heels exceed their comfort preferences, and highlights that the blouse is nearly identical to a rarely worn piece they already own. With those adjustments, the final cart becomes a polished, better-fitting outfit that works with their real body and closet instead of being a guessing game for the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario 2\n",
    "Facing an upcoming wedding and anxiety about fit, a user sends a mirror selfie. The LLM gently identifies features like broader shoulders or stronger chest and frames recommendations around comfort, movement, and highlighting what they like about themselves. It suggests silhouettes such as wrap or A-line dresses, thoughtful necklines, and hemlines that work with their shape, while avoiding cuts that tend to feel restrictive. Then it surfaces specific dress options in their size range and budget and shows how to style them with shoes and accessories they already own, transforming an overwhelming search into a focused, confidence-boosting try on list.\n"

    "\n",
    "- User adds items (e.g., blazer, trousers, blouse, heels) to their online cart.\n",
    "- User clicks “Check my cart with stylist AI” and sends cart links or a connected cart.\n",
    "- LLM pulls:\n",
    "  - Product details: size charts, materials, fit notes.\n",
    "  - Reviews: mentions of “runs small,” “tight in shoulders,” etc.\n",
    "  - User profile: measurements, proportions, comfort limits, existing wardrobe items.\n",
    "- LLM compares:\n",
    "  - Each item’s sizing vs user measurements and past fit history.\n",
    "  - New items vs current wardrobe to find duplicates or low-value pieces.\n",
    "- LLM outputs:\n",
    "  - Flags blazer as tight in shoulders → recommends one size up.\n",
    "  - Flags trouser inseam as awkward → suggests different length/size.\n",
    "  - Flags heels as beyond comfort range → suggests alternatives.\n",
    "  - Flags blouse as too similar to a rarely worn item → suggests removal.\n",
    "- User updates their cart based on recommendations (size changes, swaps, removals).\n",
    "- LLM (optionally) saves updated preferences (heel height, inseam, silhouettes) to refine future advice.\n",

    "- LLM displays a clear notice:\n",
    "  - Requests consent to analyze the image.\n",
    "  - Explains purpose: supportive, non-judgmental style guidance only.\n",
    "- After consent, LLM analyzes:\n",
    "  - Overall proportions (e.g., shoulder line, waist placement, leg length).\n",
    "  - General silhouette cues relevant to fit (without negative labels).\n",
    "- LLM converts analysis into style guidance:\n",
    "  - Recommends silhouettes like wrap or A-line dresses.\n",
    "  - Suggests necklines and hemlines that support comfort and balance.\n",
    "  - Avoids cuts likely to feel restrictive or unflattering based on user’s feedback.\n",
    "- LLM pulls product options:\n",
    "  - Filters by user’s size range, budget, color preferences, and event formality.\n",
    "  - Excludes items unavailable in appropriate sizes or outside budget.\n",
    "- LLM presents:\n",
    "  - A short, curated list of dress options with explanations: why each works for their proportions and comfort.\n",
    "  - Styling ideas using shoes and accessories the user already owns.\n",
    "- User saves favorites, decides what to try, and (optionally) updates their style preferences for future recommendations.\n"

    "## Data Needed\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario 1 – Online Cart & Fit Check**  \n",
    "To complete this scenario, the LLM needs structured user data (measurements, fit preferences, comfort limits, and a basic wardrobe inventory), provided via onboarding forms or prior interactions, plus real-time cart and product data from retailer APIs or pasted URLs (including size charts, fit notes, materials, reviews, price, and stock). From the interaction, the system generates structured outputs for each item (fit risk, recommended size, keep/remove suggestion, overlap with existing wardrobe) and updates a personalized fit/profile record (e.g., reliable inseam ranges, preferred silhouettes, brand-specific sizing patterns), which can be stored and reused to improve future recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario 2 – Photo, Body Type & Style Guidance**  \n",
    "To complete this scenario, the LLM needs an uploaded full-body image (analyzed once by a vision model), event context (wedding guest, dress code, season), user constraints (size range, budget, color preferences), and product catalog data from retailers (styles, sizes, prices). From the interaction, the system creates an abstract body/fit profile (e.g., proportional cues, recommended silhouettes), a personalized style ruleset (necklines, cuts, lengths to favor or avoid), and a curated list of recommended outfits mapped to specific products and existing items; this structured profile can be updated over time with the user’s feedback and used to tailor future styling sessions.\n"

    "## Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario 1 – Online Cart & Fit Check**  \n",
    "We’ll test success by checking whether the LLM’s recommendations meaningfully improve fit and purchasing decisions. Key metrics include: (1) **Fit accuracy** – track return/exchange rates and user feedback (“fit as expected?”) for items the AI approved vs items it warned against; (2) **Cart optimization** – measure reduction in redundant/low-value items and increased use of existing wardrobe pieces; (3) **User satisfaction** – short in-app ratings on clarity, usefulness, and trust in recommendations. We can run A/B tests where some users get AI guidance and others don’t, and compare outcomes on returns, order value, and satisfaction. Complications to consider: incomplete or inaccurate user data (wrong measurements, outdated wardrobe), noisy or missing product info, rapidly changing inventory, and conflicting review signals. The system should: fail safely by flagging uncertainty (“sizing unclear based on available data”), avoid overconfident claims, handle unexpected input (e.g., broken URLs, screenshots instead of links) with clear error messages, and be robust to adversarial prompts (e.g., users trying to make it guess sensitive traits, scrape proprietary data, or bypass store policies) by refusing or limiting those behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario 2 – Photo, Body Type & Style Guidance**  \n",
    "We’ll test success by evaluating whether users feel more confident, find suitable outfits faster, and see recommendations that truly match their proportions, constraints, and event needs. Metrics include: (1) **Perceived relevance** – user ratings on “this suits my body,” “this feels respectful,” and “I would actually wear this”; (2) **Engagement & conversions** – saves, clicks, and purchases from recommended items vs random baselines; (3) **Error & harm checks** – audits for biased, body-shaming, or non-inclusive suggestions. We will use structured human review and test sets of diverse body types and style preferences to validate outputs. Complications include poor-quality photos (bad lighting, occlusions), edge cases (non-standard poses, mobility aids, cultural garments), and users uploading images of others or explicit/adversarial content. The system should: detect low-confidence image analysis and respond cautiously (“here are general options” instead of precise claims), enforce consent (no analysis without it), reject disallowed or third-party images, avoid inferring sensitive traits (e.g., health status, gender identity) from photos, and provide explanations so users can understand and correct misinterpretations rather than being silently misclassified.\n"
