    "# Emily’s First Scenario\n",
    "## Short description:\n",
    "Shopping for a formal dress under $100 for a black-tie event.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Narrative of the scenario:\n",
    "The user has been invited to a formal ball event and wants to find an elegant dress that fits the event’s black-tie dress code while staying within a $100 budget and sticking with the event theme, *Under the Sea*. The user opens the Fashion.AI platform and types in their request . Fashion.AI interprets the user’s needs — event type, formality level, budget, and personal style preferences —  and generates outfit recommendations that can be purchased online. The platform provides clickable shopping links and allows the user to filter by color, fabric, or silhouette. It also offers AI styling advice such as suggested shoes or accessories or hairstyle to complete the look affordably.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step-by-step breakdown of the interaction:\n",
    "1) User opens Fashion.AI and selects “Event Outfit Generator.”\n",
    "2) User types: “I’m going to a formal ball and need a dress under $100. The theme is *Under the Sea.*”\n",
    "3) The app asks follow-up questions:\n",
    "* “Do you prefer a particular color or fabric?”\n",
    "* “Would you like something long or short — i.e. maxi or mini?”\n",
    "* “What’s your body type or size range?”\n",
    "4) The user answers: “I prefer a long satin or chiffon dress, size small, in dark colors.”\n",
    "5) Fashion.AI searches online retailers (e.g., H&M, Aritzia, ASOS, Lulus) for options matching the criteria.\n",
    "6) The app displays a curated list of 5-10 dresses, each with:\n",
    "* Image preview\n",
    "* Price\n",
    "* Link to buy\n",
    "* AI-generated style tips (e.g., “Pair this with silver heels and a clutch”)\n",
    "7) User clicks a link to purchase or saves their favorite look to their “Event Closet.”\n",
    "8) Fashion.AI updates the user’s style profile with new data about preferences (color, fit, budget).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data description:\n",
    "* Needed for the app to engage and complete the scenario:\n",
    "* User input data:\n",
    "\t* Event type (e.g., black-tie ball)\n",
    "\t* Budget (numeric input: <$100)\n",
    "\t* Dress preferences (color, length, fabric, size)\n",
    "* System data sources:\n",
    "\t* Online store APIs or web-scraped product databases (H&M, Artizia, Lulus, etc.)\n",
    "\t* Pre-trained LLM embedded for fashion classification and styling knowledge\n",
    "* Data created as a result of the interaction:\n",
    "\t* Structured product recommendation list (in this format: {item_name, price, link, color, material})\n",
    "\t* Updated user preference profile (color choices, preferred brands, price range)\n",
    "\t* Engagement metrics (clicks, saves, purchase)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation\n",
    "* Success criteria:\n",
    "\t* AI returns at least three relevant dress options under $100.\n",
    "\t* The links lead to actual purchasable items (in stick, correct price range).\n",
    "\t* The suggestions match the requested event formality and style preferences.\n",
    "* Possible complications or errors:\n",
    "\t* Price data may be outdated or scraped incorrectly.\n",
    "\t* Some links might lead to sold-out or unavailable items.\n",
    "\t* The AI might misunderstand “black-tie” and suggest semi-formal or casual dresses; even worse if it recommends outfits with an actual black tie.\n",
    "\t* If user input is vague (“something nice”), the app may need to ask clarifying questions to narrow results.\n",
    "\t* Risk of bias in product sourcing (limited diversity in body types, skin tones, or style representation).\n",

    "# Emily’s Second Scenario\n",
    "## Short description:\n",
    "Choosing an outfit for a first date based on the other person’s personality, fashion style, and date setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Narrative of scenario:\n",
    "The user is preparing for a first date and wants to make a good impression. Instead of only focusing on their own preferences, the user uses Fashion.AI to generate an outfit that complements both their personal style and the personality or aesthetic of the person they are meeting. The user provides basic information about the date (e.g., location, activity) and a short description of the person — their fashion sense, demeanor, or social media presence. Fashion.AI analyzes these inputs and produces a cohesive outfit suggestion that balances attractiveness, comfort, and context-appropriateness.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step-by-step breakdown of the interaction:\n",
    "1) User opens Fashion.AI and selects “Date Outfit Generator.”\n",
    "2) User types: “Help me pick an outfit for my first date.”\n",
    "3) The app prompts follow-up questions:\n",
    "* “Where is the date taking place?”\n",
    "* “What’s the other person’s personality or style like?”\n",
    "* “How would you describe your own fashion preferences?”\n",
    "4) The user responds:\n",
    "* “It’s a dinner date at an Italian restaurant.”\n",
    "* “He’s laid-back and artsy — usually wears vintage jackets and sneakers.”\n",
    "* “I like minimalist, slightly dressy outfits.”\n",
    "5) Fashion.AI analyzes the date context (casual-dressy), inferred vibe (artsy/creative), and user style.\n",
    "6) The app generates multiple outfit options, each with:\n",
    "* Clothing items (top, bottom, shoes, accessories)\n",
    "* Rationale for the recommendation (“Balances casual and chic for a relaxed dinner setting”)\n",
    "* Option to adjust tone (e.g., “Make it flirtier” or “More casual”)\n",
    "7) User browses and selects a favorite outfit.\n",
    "8) Fashion.AI provides shopping links for any items the user doesn’t already own.\n",
    "9) The chosen look is saved to the user’s “Date Night” folder for future reference.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Evaluation:\n",
    "* Success criteria:\n",
    "\t* Generated outfits are context-appropriate for the date setting.\n",
    "\t* The AI’s interpretation of the other person’s style matches the description given.\n",
    "\t* The user finds at least one outfit they feel confident and comfortable in wearing.\n",
    "* Possible complications or errors:\n",
    "\t* If the user gives vague or incomplete input (“He dresses normally”), Fashion.AI might produce overly generic results.\n",
    "\t* Misinterpretation of tone (e.g., the AI suggests something too formal for a casual coffee date).\n",
    "\t* Inaccuracy in style prediction if social media reference photos don’t match real-life fashion.\n",
    "\t* Privacy considerations when processing data about a non-user (the date).\n",
    "\t* Cultural or gender biases in “appropriate date attire” suggestions.\n",

    "Invited to a party with an ambiguous theme\n",
    "\n",
    "## Narrative of the scenario:\n",
    "The user was invited to his friend’s birthday brunch and the theme of the party is “garden vibes.” He does not know what to wear to the event, given the vague theme and he does not want to buy new clothes for the party either. Since the user has uploaded his wardrobe into Fashion.AI, he opens the LLM and asks the AI to generate an outfit, using his preexisting clothes, for a “Garden vibes birthday brunch.” The user also uploaded the invitation for the brunch so the LLM can understand the aesthetic further. The LLM then pulls pieces of his clothes to generate an outfit that fits the theme of the party, without prompting the user to buy something else. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Step-by-step breakdown of the interaction:\n",
    "1) User opens Fashion.AI and selects “Event Outfit Generator.”\n",
    "2) User types: “I got invited to my friend’s birthday brunch and the theme is garden vibes.” \n",
    "3) User then uploaded an image of the invitation for the birthday party. \n",
    "4) The LLM responses: “Thank you! Based on the information you provided, the brunch is casual and relaxed, with a theme pulling on earth tones and pastels. Would you like me to generate an outfit based on your current wardrobe, provide recommendations for buying new clothes for this event, or a mix of both?”\n",
    "5) The user responds: “Can you generate an outfit based on clothes I already have?”\n",
    "6) The LLM response: “Yes! For this event, you can wear your *khaki pants* and *light blue button up shirt*. For shoes, wear your *brown dress shoes.* No need to accessorize for this event!” \n",
    "7) The user can then accept this outfit or ask the LLM to generate another one.\n",

    "## Narrative of the scenario:\n",
    "The user notices that Urban Outfitters is having a Black Friday sale and wants to take advantage of the discounted clothing. Since Fashion.AI has an understanding of the user’s wardrobe and preferences, the user asks Fashion.AI to generate purchase recommendations for the sale based on current gaps in their wardrobe. The LLM then provides a list of clothes the user can purchase at Urban Outfitters that fit into their closet, fill gaps into their wardrobe, and allow the user to experiment with new styles and trends. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Step-by-step breakdown of the interaction:\n",
    "1) User opens Fashion.AI and selects “Shop & Fill My Closet”\n",
    "2) User tells Fashion.AI: “Urban Outfitters is having a Black Friday sale, help me pick what clothes I should by”\n",
    "3) The LLM responses asking for more information: “What is your budget? Do you want to fill gaps in your wardrobe, try out new styles, or more?” \n",
    "4) The user responses: “I want to fill gaps in my wardrobe”\n",
    "5) Fashion.AI pulls the user’s uploaded wardrobe data (styles, colors, missing categories, frequently worn items, and disliked items). The LLM analyzes the user’s closet for gaps and identifies complementary styles the user is likely to wear. The system queries Urban Outfitters’ Black Friday discounted inventory and filters items by the user’s constraints (price, size availability, etc).\n",
    "6) Fashion.AI generates a list of recommended purchases: “Consider purchasing the skate fit dark wash baggy jeans since you only have a light wash pair. Also consider purchasing the red cable knit sweater since you do not have any red tops in your current closet” \n",

    "\n",
    "## Narrative of the scenario:\n",
    "Before a high-stakes interview, the user has selected a blazer, trousers, blouse, and heels, all in their usual size, and added them to an online shopping cart. The user uploads their cart to the LLM, which already knows their measurements, shoulder width, inseam, comfort limits for heel height, and current wardrobe. The system analyzes product details and reviews, flags sizing risks (e.g., blazer runs small, trouser inseam is off, heels exceed comfort), and identifies items that overlap with pieces already owned. The user then updates the cart based on recommendations, resulting in a polished, well-fitting outfit that suits their real body and wardrobe, reducing guesswork and improving confidence in the purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step-by-step breakdown of the interaction:\n",
    "1. User adds items (blazer, trousers, blouse, heels) to an online shopping cart.\n",
    "2. User clicks “Check my cart with stylist AI” and sends cart links or connects the cart.\n",
    "3. LLM retrieves:\n",
    "   * Product details (size charts, materials, fit notes)\n",
    "   * Customer reviews (mentions of “runs small,” “tight in shoulders,” etc.)\n",
    "   * User profile (measurements, proportions, comfort limits, wardrobe inventory)\n",
    "4. LLM compares:\n",
    "   * Item sizing vs user measurements and past fit history\n",
    "   * New items vs existing wardrobe for duplicates or low-value pieces\n",
    "5. LLM outputs recommendations:\n",
    "   * Flag blazer as tight in shoulders → recommend one size up\n",
    "   * Flag trouser inseam → suggest alternative length\n",
    "   * Flag heels → recommend within comfort range\n",
    "   * Flag blouse as too similar to rarely worn piece → suggest removal\n",
